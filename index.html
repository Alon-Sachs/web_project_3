                        <p class="place__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the
                            shores
                            of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless
                            they
                            grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here,
                            and
                            the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                            architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of
                            the
                            Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels.
                            The
                            left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live
                            on
                            the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                            rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in
                            the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                            Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                            world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally
                            sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom
                            award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also
                            home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of
                            the UK.</p>

                            town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts
                            capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                            handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a
                            yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                            wooden spoon.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                            College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially
                            integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
                            tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship. </p>

                            Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape,
                            it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of
                            Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals</p>

                            think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the
                            coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                            plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.

                            altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and

                            of the Hefer Valley Regional Council. The village is between the Highway 6 highway to the
                            west and the Green Line on the east. In 2019 it had a population of 5,301.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">Bat Hefer was founded as "Sokho" and named after the ancient town by
                            the same name. Construction of the modern village began in 1995, and the first residents
                            moved in during 1996. It was built as part of the Seven Stars project.

                            The locality was constructed mostly on lands belonging to the depopulated village of Qaqun,
                            as well as lands belonging to the villages Deir al-Ghusun and Shwiaka on the other side of
